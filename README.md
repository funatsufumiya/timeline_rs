### Indirectly referenced projects

This work is heavily inspired by [ofxTimeline](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/ofxTimeline) of [YCAMInterlab](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab), not only the code, but also the concept and the spirit. And highly intended to use data created by ofxTimeline and [loaf_timeline](https://github.com/funatsufumiya/loaf_timeline/) (lua/oF scripting environment using ofxTimeline).

Some code-bases are referenced from ofxTimeline, and some dependencies are also referenced like ofxEasing and ofxTween.
